ATRAN data directory
====================

This directory contains data files for atmospheric correction.

Note that this distribution contains a minimal reference set, to
keep the package size small.  ATRAN files specific to observational
conditions may be generated from data provided by the
`ATRAN server <https://atran.arc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/atran/atran.cgi>`,
or may be provided `on request <sofia_help@sofia.usra.edu>`_.
